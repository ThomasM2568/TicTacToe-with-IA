### TicTacToe-with-IA ###

I'm currently working on a text only TicTacToe game in Python 3.7, in which you can play against an IA.
At this stage, you can only play against a real player. I'll implement the IA when the game is 100% functional.
If you want to learn more about my project, you can contact me on discord Tfx_#9596
